# Horiseon - accessibility-code-refactor

<h2>Description</h2>
 
This project is a code refactor of the Horiseon webpage. I was tasked with making the code more accessible and semantic. After the proper semantic updates, the website will prove to be optimized for SEO without breaking the live view styling of the page, and improving the flow of the underlying code.

<h2>Tasks Completed</h2>

* Consolidated repetitive classes and added specification.
* 'alt' texts were added to the images.
* HTML elements were replaced with HTML semantic tags/elements.
* Added comments in the HTML/CSS documents for clarity.
* CSS stylesheet has classes and elements structured more cohesivley.
* A more descriptive title was added.
