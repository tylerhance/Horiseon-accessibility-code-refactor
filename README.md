# Horiseon - accessibility-code-refactor

##Description
 
This project is a code refactor of the Horiseon webpage. I was tasked with making the code more accessible and semantic. After the proper semantic updates, the website will prove to be optimized for SEO without breaking the live view styling of the page, only the code underneath.

###Tasks Completed
* Consolidated repetitive classes.
* 'alt' texts were added to the images.
* HTML elements were replaced with semantic elements.
* Added comments in the HTML/CSS documents.
* CSS stylesheet had classes and elements structured more cohesivley.
* A descriptive title was added.
